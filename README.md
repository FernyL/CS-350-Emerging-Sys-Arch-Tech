# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
There are two projects included. The project uart2echo uses a state machine to turn an LED light off and on whenever the user types "ON" or "OFF". The project gpiointerrupt flicks the LED lights off and on using morse code to display the messages "sos" and "ok". 

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did pretty well with keeping the code simple and organized using proper coding standards and not over complicating things.

# Where could you improve?
I feel like I could have improved my work in the gpiointerrupt project by using a state machine to blink the lights for the morse code. This was my first experience with Code Composer Studio and I feel like if I had more knowledge I could have made it work more smoothly.

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I can now add Code Composer Studio with the use of some drivers as some of the tools and resources I used to my support network.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
From these projects I can particularly transer the skills of designing state machines and my experience with working on peripherals to other projects or course work.

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this project maintainable and readable by keeping the code simple, organized, using proper naming conventions, and adding some comments to describe what was happening throughout the code. The projects are adaptable because they use modular design and use functions while following coding standards.
